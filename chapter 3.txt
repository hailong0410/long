NaÃ¯ve Gauss elimination

1. Forward Elimination of Unknowns
a. Reduce the coefficient matrix [A] to an upper triangular system
b. Eliminate x1

from the 2nd to nth Eqns.

c. Eliminate x2

from the 3rd to nth Eqns.

d. Continue process until the nth equation has only 1 Non-Zero coefficient

2. Back-substituted
a. Starting from the last equation, => find xn
b. Substitute to (n-1)th equation => find xn-1
c. Each of the unknowns is found
